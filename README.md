Introduction: Clinical applications of electroencephalography (EEG)
span a very broad range of diagnostic conditions. Epileptic seizure
is the fourth most common neurological disorder in that. Related
Work: There has been considerable progress in clinical understanding
of epilepsy, however many aspects of seizure prevention are still
a mystery. Predictive modeling of EEG can provide significant value
addition to substantiate the diagnosis of epilepsy. Methodology:
Machine learning algorithms are applied to predict the probability
of epileptic seizure using an open source multi-class dataset. Results
and Discussion: Comparing the F-score from different classifiers,
it is found that XGBoost gives the best performance in binary
classification and Random Forest provides the best performance
in multinomial classification. Conclusion: Our results show that
it is possible to predict epileptic seizure with significant accuracy
from non-epileptic parameters using a suitable machine learning
algorithm. We also observe that binary classification methods have
higher prediction accuracy.
